# Covid-tracker application
 In these pandemic times, itâ€™s very important for one to be alert about the cases. In order to overcome this, I came up with this project.This GUI let us take a single country name or multiple names at a time. A button should be provided and on clicking that the data distinguished by country names appear on the window. This app also displays graphs for better visualisation and analysis.

Libraries Used:

matplotlib
Covid
Tkinter
